• This project focuses on music genre classification using 
Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) applied to the 
GTZAN dataset.

• By leveraging advanced deep learning techniques, the 
aim is to automate the process of categorizing audio 
excerpts into various genres such as country, classical, 
disco, pop, hip-hop, jazz, metal, reggae, blues, and rock. 

• The project involves feature extraction from audio clips 
using the Librosa library, pre-processing steps including 
normalization and label encoding, splitting the dataset 
into training and validation sets, and building a CNN 
model with dense layers and optimization techniques like 
dropout and early stopping to enhance performance and 
prevent overfitting. 

• Results are visualized, showcasing the model's accuracy 
and loss metrics, and insights into feature importance are 
gained through analysis with the Random Forest 
algorithm.
